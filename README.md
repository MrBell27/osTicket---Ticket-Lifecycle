1. Copy, past and open this link http://localhost/osTicket/ in your web browser to open the support center where we will open a new ticket as one of the Users we created in the previous section of the lab. When you click in the email box you should see a list of users you created appear. Choose one. At the bottom of the screen you can create your own issue that your user is experiencing. Repeat this process a couple times with different Help Topics.

2. Now lets go back to osTicket and log-in as one of the Agents we created so we can solve the user tickets. Now that we are logged in we can see the tickets that were created by the users. Select one and we will set the SLA and we can even assign the ticket to an Agent. Depending on the severigty of the issue you as the agent can set the priority, department and agent it is assigned to. You can leave notes for other agents to see as well. Once the issue is resolved you can select 'resolved' from the drop down menu at the bottom and close out the ticket. You will see the ticket has dissappeared from the 'Open' tickets section and is now in the 'Closed' tickets section. That concludes the lab. Feel free to practice more in the osTicket enviornment and familiarize yourself with it.

LAST STEP: Don't forget to log back into your Azure account and delete the resource group you created for this lab. If you keep it running you will be charged from you FREE $200 Subcription account. ALso it is good practice to delete any Virtual Machines you created after you are finished with them.
